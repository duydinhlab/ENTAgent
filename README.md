## 🔍 Overview

ENTAgent is a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework for complex reasoning and decision support in **Otolaryngology (ENT)**.  
It integrates:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Self-Mixture of Agents (MoA)  
- Verbal Reinforcement Learning (Reflexion)  
- Tool-augmented research (PubMed, ArXiv, Google Search)

ENTAgent provides accurate, explainable, and self-correcting responses for:

- Short-answer clinical questions  
- Essay-type medical examinations  
- Large-scale board-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs)

---

## 📈 Key Features

- Domain-specific medical knowledge base (textbooks, guidelines, journals)  
- Self-aggregation of multiple LLM responses (Mixture-of-Agents)  
- Reflexion-based self-critique and iterative refinement  
- Autonomous literature search and evidence grounding  
- Explainable scoring and reasoning loop

## 📊 Performance

| Task | Baseline LLM | ENTAgent |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Short Q&A Accuracy | 70% | **81.3% (+11.3%)** |
| Essay Length | 153 words | **425 words (2.78×)** |
| MCQ (BoardVitals) | 71% (Human Avg) | **75.5% (Statistically Significant)** |

## 🧠 System Architecture

1. **RAG Agent** – retrieves ENT knowledge from vector database (FAISS + Voyage embeddings)  
2. **Self-Mixture of Agents** – generates and aggregates multiple in-model answers  
3. **Evaluation Agent (Reflexion)** – scores, critiques, and plans revisions  
4. **Research Agent** – searches PubMed, ArXiv, and web sources  
5. **Revisor Agent** – refines and corrects answers iteratively
